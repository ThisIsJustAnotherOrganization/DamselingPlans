# Deep TFP

## Preperation
* Prep as usual and as requested by the seer.    
* Don't cruise out, but move inside the EZ as deep as you can.  

## Deviations
* Just before the drillee enters the correct system enter a 5 minute CR state

## Desired Effect
* The drillee learns how to TFP and cope with those situations.
* The drillee learns to stay calm under pressure
