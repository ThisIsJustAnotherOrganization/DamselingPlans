# Out of control by MHajoha
# Somebody was going at quite a speed when they deactivated their thrusters, weren't they?

## Preparation

Position yourself a few kls away from the main star, just as normal. After dropping, turn off FA and put yourself into a spin.

## Variations

You may also want to give yourself some movement in any direction for added pressure.
If you want to confuse the poor drillee even more, feel free to fire your engines from time to time.

## Desired effect

While a spinning client or one who fires his engines is rather rare, a client moving has been known to happen.
The drillee would be expected, in this scenario, to (after firing a few limpets immediately after dropping) report the client's situation to dispatch and to, if applicable, ask the client to cease firing their engines and to slow down before continueing to refuel the client.
